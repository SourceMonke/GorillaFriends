Fixed for the lastest version
# How it works
_Also reminder there will not be a list of outdated and new mods - Also dont yell at me for changing the stuff_
"add Friend" button is on LEFT side now (bruh, that was a bad idea to place it on the RIGHT SIDE BETWEEN MUTE AND REPORT);
Added "Played recently with ..." statement! Now you can see if you're played with this guy before (i hope it works, butthurting implementation);
Tweakable colors of "Recently player with ..." and "Friend". Verified color is ALWAYS GREEN.
